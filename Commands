On windows, we can use gitbash to use the commands (like the command prompt)

cd: change directory
pwd: print working directory
ls: list the current directory

$ pwd
/c/Users/Pomme/AppData/Roaming/SPB_16.6
This is the default directory of gitbash
we can use the command 
"start ." to open the current directory
"cd .." goes back the directory

copy: "ctrl+ins"
paste:"shift+ins"


$ git clone http://blablabla.com   --> downloads and creates a clone of the existing repository on the computer
modify and save on PC
$ git status --> shows the status. When it is saved, we sort of "commit" but not properly so we have to commit the changes
$ git commit -a -m "adding the changes"
(-a for all, and -m for the message)

When you commit, the difference between github and gitbash is that the PC does not know who you are so you have to identify (sign in)
in order to tell the PC which user of git we are:
$  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
And it has to be exactly the same thing as what we signed in github

$ git commit -a -m "adding the changes"
If the commit works, we see:
[master 9e66107] adding the changes
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)

$ git log
to see the log of the changes,  who changed what on the document

If we get into a infinite loop (VIM text editor + command) 
we can type 
:q
and we should get back to the initial point

Now we have to push to github to save the changes to github interface
we need to specify the remote and the branch
$ git push origin master
You have to identify yourself
