Definitions: 

Repository (Repo) = project

to commit = to save
Every commit has a unique identifier called "hash"
That's why we can track the history

Branch = another path of the network to create another version that we can merge to the main called "master"
pull-request = propose to merge branch with master

To vizualize the repository progress (how many branch, fork...)
Main code -> insight -> network 
we can see the master and branch in a graph

Fork is when another person (with another account) can create a total copy of the file, and modify the file with its master and branches.
--> pull request to merge the document

issue is where we leave comments, ask questions...
When an issue is open, it can be closed by referring the issue number in the new commit solving the issue (#issuenumber) 
actually not closed but it will show in the issue interface the modification for #issuenumber, and then we can see the changes directly in the issue interface and close it.
