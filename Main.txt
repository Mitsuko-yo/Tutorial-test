Definitions: 

Repository (Repo) = project

to commit = to save
Every commit has a unique identifier called "hash"
That's why we can track the history

Branch = another path of the network to create another version that we can merge to the main called "master"
pull-request = propose to merge branch with master

To vizualize the repository progress (how many branch, fork...)
Main code -> insight -> network 
we can see the master and branch in a graph
